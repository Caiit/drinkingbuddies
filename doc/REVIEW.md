# Peer review

Some onCancelled methods are empty, maybe call a Toast or log so that you know that it is called.

Class headers are missing.

Comments are good and compact.

Some files contain a lot of random white spaces.

Check how to fix line breaks.

Variable names are clear.

Nice compact methods.

MainActivity initializes the firebase variables twice.

Layout of app: change order: first img, followed by name and star.

Use default image if no image present.

Use smaller text size.
